# G2 path smoothing with quadratic Bezier curve
## High-Fidelity and Curvature-Continuous Path Smoothing with Quadratic Bezier Curve

G2-continuous trajectories are crucial for vehicles under non-holonomic dynamic constraints to run smoothly. In this paper, we present a path smoothing method based on piecewise quadratic Bezier curves, which can fit a set of sequential 2D collision-free path points generated by a higher-level path planner. The generated trajectories are G2-continuous except at the inflection points, and points of local curvature maxima appear exactly at path points and nowhere else. The local curvature control ensures that the trajectories keep high fidelity with the original paths, thus maintaining key properties of the original
paths, such as free collision and gentle turns. Furthermore, we develop a joint optimization method for both fidelity and continuity, which has an efficient analytical solution for each iteration. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real scenarios validate that the proposed method performs better in terms of fidelity, continuity, efficiency, and practicability.
